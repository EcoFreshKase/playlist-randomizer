# playlist-randomizer
A small React app that makes use of Redux, React Router and Material UI

Motivation: Youtube is not consistent with the way it randomizes large playlists (especially when casting to a device), so I built this small app that fetches info about a given public playlist and enables the user to randomize it, and play it or cast it. All the data is being stored in local storage, so whenever you come back to the app, all your previous loaded playlists will be there. 

A demo is available at http://www.playlist-randomizer.com/ (please be a little patient with the initial load, it's being hosted for free on Heroku and the app is dormant when not in use)
